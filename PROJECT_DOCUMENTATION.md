## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Telegram Mini App Initialization

One of the most significant challenges was ensuring proper initialization of the Telegram Mini App:

**Challenge**: The Telegram Web App SDK must be properly initialized at the right moment in the page load process, but timing can be inconsistent across devices and network conditions.

**Solution**: A multi-layered initialization approach:
- Early initialization attempt before DOM content loads
- Secondary initialization when DOM content is loaded
- Final attempt when the window is fully loaded
- Comprehensive logging system for debugging
- Global namespace to prevent conflicts and maintain state
- Initialization state tracking and recovery mechanisms
- Timeout-based fallbacks for edge cases

### SPA Navigation in GitHub Pages

**Challenge**: GitHub Pages doesn't natively support SPA routing, causing 404 errors when directly accessing non-root URLs.

**Solution**: 
- Custom 404.html page that preserves the requested URL
- Client-side redirection script that correctly routes to the intended component
- URL normalization to handle both direct access and in-app navigation
- Debug logging system to track redirection process
- History API integration for state management
- Path parameter preservation during redirects
- Hash-based fallback for environments with limited history API support

### WebTorrent in Restricted Environments

**Challenge**: WebTorrent requires specific browser features that may be limited in some mobile environments or Telegram's WebView.

**Solution**:
- Feature detection and graceful degradation
- Fallback mechanism for direct content delivery when WebTorrent isn't viable
- Optimized connection handling to work within Telegram's constraints
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Progressive enhancement strategy for advanced features
- WebRTC compatibility checks with appropriate user feedback
- Alternative streaming sources for critical content
