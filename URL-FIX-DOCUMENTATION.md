# URL Fix Documentation

## Overview

We've implemented a comprehensive solution to fix the issue with different URL formats for the watch page. The goal was to ensure that all links direct to the working version at `/pages/watch` instead of the non-working `/pages/watch.html`.

## Changes Made

### 1. URL Format Standardization

We updated all links in the codebase to use the clean URL format:
- Changed links from: `/pages/watch.html?id=xxx`
- To: `/pages/watch?id=xxx`

### 2. Link Sources Updated

We modified direct links to the watch page in the following files:

- **main.js**: Updated movie item click handlers to use the clean URL format
- **account.js**: Updated watch page navigation links
- **index.html**: Updated all hardcoded links, including:
  - Featured movie navigation
  - Test video card navigation
  - Content card creation links

### 3. Redirection Implementation

We implemented both client-side and server-side redirection to handle any remaining or external links:

- **Client-side**: Added a script to watch.html that redirects if accessed directly with `.html` extension
- **Server-side**: Configured express server to redirect `/pages/watch.html` to `/pages/watch`

### 4. Technical Solution Details

1. **URL Generation Updated**:
   ```javascript
   // Old:
   window.location.href = 'pages/watch.html?id=' + contentId;
   
   // New:
   window.location.href = 'pages/watch?id=' + contentId;
   ```

2. **Server Redirection**:
   ```javascript
   // Redirect /pages/watch.html to /pages/watch with same query params
   app.get('/pages/watch.html', (req, res) => {
       const queryString = Object.keys(req.query).length 
           ? '?' + new URLSearchParams(req.query).toString() 
           : '';
       res.redirect(301, '/pages/watch' + queryString);
   });
   ```

3. **Fallback Script in watch.html**:
   ```javascript
   // Only run on watch.html
   if (window.location.pathname.endsWith('/watch.html')) {
       const queryString = window.location.search || '';
       const newUrl = window.location.origin + 
                     window.location.pathname.replace('watch.html', 'watch') + 
                     queryString;
       window.location.replace(newUrl);
   }
   ```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Consistency**: All links now direct to the same working URL format
2. **Minimal Changes**: No modifications were made to watch.js
3. **WebTorrent Preservation**: All WebTorrent functionality remains untouched
4. **Future-Proof**: The solution will work for all future videos added to the platform
5. **Dual-Protection**: Both client and server-side redirects ensure reliable behavior

## Testing

To verify the solution:
1. Start the server with `node server-config.js`
2. Test clicking on videos from the homepage
3. Verify direct access to `/pages/watch?id=sample-video-1` works as expected
4. Test that direct access to `/pages/watch.html?id=sample-video-1` properly redirects
